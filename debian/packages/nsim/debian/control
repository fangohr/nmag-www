Description: The "nsim" finite element field theory simulation framework
 This is the "nsim" field theory simulation framework
 on which the micromagnetic simulator "nmag" is based.
 .
 This preliminary debian package provides both nsim and nmag.
 Note that - as this piece of software still is in a state
 of flux - there are a number of issues (e.g. manpages,
 location of some files, contents of the source tarball)
 where this package does not yet adhere to all of the 
 expectations one has of a neat and tidy debian package.
 Rather, this should be regarded as a first step to bring
 nsim/nmag under package manager control in order to make
 installation, upgrading, and de-installation an easy and
 straightforward task.
