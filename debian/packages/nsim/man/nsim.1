nsim, nsim_i, ncol, nmesh, nmeshimport, nmeshpp, nsim-1cpu, nsimversion,
nmagpp, nmesh2vtk, nmeshmirror, pyfem, ipyfem
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These commands belong to the "nsim" generic finite element based classical
field theory simulator suite. At present, the corresponding documentation
can be found at /usr/lib/nsim/interface/manual. As this is a preliminary
release of the nsim packages where much is still in a state of flux,
especially concerning the commands to start the system, no individual
manpages are being provided for now. We apologize for any inconvenience.
.PP
Most likely, you received this package as an early pre-release of the
nsim simulator suite, which means that you belong to the circle of 
early users. So, in case of problems, feel free to ask the nsim team
for help or advice.
