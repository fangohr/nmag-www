nmag
====

nmag is a micromagnetic simulation package based on the general
purpose multi-physics library `nsim
<http://www.soton.ac.uk/~fangohr/nsim/index.html>`__. It is developed
by the group of Hans Fangohr and Thomas Fischbacher in the `School of
Engineering Sciences <http://www.soton.ac.uk/ses>`__ at the
`University of Southampton <http://www.soton.ac.uk>`__ and released
under the `GNU GPL <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl2.txt>`__.


Features in brief:

 - based on finite elements (suitable for non-cuboidal structures)

 - problem description in Python, therefore high degree of flexibility

 - inbuilt mesh post processing tools

 - efficient data storage (binary compressed) and extraction into vtk
   files (of course the raw data can be extracted)

 - arbitrary crystal anisotropy 

 - (pseudo) periodic boundary conditions ("macro geometry approach")

 - extensive documentation in `html <current/manual/html/manual.html>`__ 
   and `pdf <current/manual/manual.pdf>`__, including Tutorial

 - `download <current/download.html>`__ as source, debian package and
   bootable CD ISO image
