Nmag
====

Nmag is a micromagnetic simulation package. It has been developed at
the University of Southampton with substantial contributions from Hans
Fangohr, Thomas Fischbacher, Matteo Franchin. It is released under the
`GNU GPL <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl2.txt>`__.


Features in brief:

 - based on finite elements (suitable for non-cuboidal structures)

 - problem description in Python, therefore high degree of flexibility

 - inbuilt mesh post processing tools

 - efficient data storage (binary compressed) and extraction into vtk
   files (of course the raw data can be extracted)

 - arbitrary crystal anisotropy 

 - (pseudo) periodic boundary conditions ("macro geometry approach")

 - Spin torque transfer (Zhang-Li model for uniform current density)

 - Supports use of matrix compression library (HLib) for BEM

 - extensive documentation in `html <current/manual/html/manual.html>`__ 
   and `pdf <current/manual/manual.pdf>`__, including Tutorial

 - `download <download.html>`__ as source tarball `with all libraries <current/download/all>`__,
   or only `the core nmag code <current/download/core>`__ (see `installation <current/install/index.html>`__)
