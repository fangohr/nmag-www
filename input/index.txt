nmag
====

nmag is a micromagnetic simulation package based on the general
purpose multi-physics library `nsim
<http://www.soton.ac.uk/~fangohr/nsim/index.html>`__. It is developed
by the group of Hans Fangohr and Thomas Fischbacher in the `School of
Engineering Sciences <http://www.soton.ac.uk/ses>`__ at the
`University of Southampton <http://www.soton.ac.uk>`__ and released
under the `GNU GPL <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl2.txt>`__.


Features in brief:

 - based on finite elements (suitable for non-cuboidal structures)

 - problem description in Python, therefore high degree of flexibility

 - inbuilt mesh post processing tools

 - efficient data storage (binary compressed) and extraction into vtk
   files (of course the raw data can be extracted)

 - arbitrary crystal anisotropy 

 - (pseudo) periodic boundary conditions ("macro geometry approach")

 - extensive documentation in `html <current/manual/html/manual.html>`__ 
   and `pdf <current/manual/manual.pdf>`__, including Tutorial

 - `download <current/download.html>`__ as source, debian package and
   bootable CD ISO image

* *20 November 2008* 

  Update `0.1 beta (5962) <0.1/index.html>`__


* *10 - 14 November, MMM Austin, Texas*

  Matteo Franchin and Andreas Knittel represent the Nmag team at the
  MMM. They are happy to approached with Nmag-related queries. They
  will give the following presentations:

  :Session: EH Numerical Methods and Magnetic Simulations

  :Date: Thursday 13 November 2008

  :Time: 9:24: *The macro geometry* (new approach to periodic boundary conditions as `available in Nmag <http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/nmag/current/manual/html/manual.html#example-1d-periodicity>`__)

  :Time: 9:36: *Scriptability and interactive parallel micromagnetic simulations* (about the Nmag concept of 'writing micromagnetic simulation programs')

  :Time: 9:48: *Matrix compression using the H-Lib* (for large simulations of systems with large surface area) 

  :Location: Meeting Room 410

  They will also attend the Open Forum on Micromagnetic Modelling
  Wednesday evening (20:00-22:00).
