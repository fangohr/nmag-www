Download version 0.1
====================

* `Source code <0.1/download>`__ (`Installation instructions <0.1/install/install_a.html>`__)

* `VMWare Virtual Machine <vmware/0.1/>`__ (`Installation instructions <0.1/install/vmplayer.html>`__)

* `A Knoppix-based stand-alone Live Linux system <cd-images/>`__ (Knoppix based)

Note that the source-code distribution will always be the most recent,
and updates of the Virtual machine and Knoppix-based system may lag
somewhat. The filenames should reveal the release number.
