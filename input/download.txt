  Download version 0.1
  ====================
  
  * `Source code <0.1/download>`__ (`Installation instructions <0.1/install/install_a.html>`__)
  
  * `VMWare Virtual Machine <vmware/0.1/>`__ (`Installation instructions <0.1/install/vmplayer.html>`__)
  
  * `A Knoppix-based stand-alone Live Linux system <cd-images/>`__ (Knoppix based)
  
  Note that the source-code distribution will always be the most recent,
  and updates of the Virtual machine and Knoppix-based system may lag
  somewhat. The filenames should reveal the release number.
