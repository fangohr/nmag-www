 How to upgrade Nmag
=====================

.. contents:: Overview


Introduction
------------

How to upgrade Nmag depends on the way it which it has been installed.

Method A: compile everything from source
----------------------------------------

If you have compiled Nmag `from source <install/install_a.html>`__, you have two options:

*   optionally move the old installation directory (``nmag-0.1``) to a
    different location (or, if you feel brave, delete it), then
    download the whole tar-file (nmag-0.1.tar.gz), and repeat the
    installation. This is the safe way, but it will take the same time
    to compile as the initial install, as all supporting libraries
    will be re-compiled.

*   Alternatively, ``cd`` into the ``nmag-0.1`` directory, i.e.::

       $> cd nmag-0.1
     
    and run the ``make update`` command, i.e.::

       $nmag-0.1> make update

    This will download just the Nmag-specific code (that is
    everything in the subdirectory ``nmag-0.1/nsim``). A subsequent
    call of ``make`` will compile the new downloaded version::

       $nmag-0.1> make

    This way of upgrading is expected to (usually) work, but is
    somewhat experimental. If this doesn't work for you, please let
    us know.

    In particular, this may fail if any changes to the supporting
    libraries have taken place, but we will try to include this
    information in any upgrade announcements.

To check whether the upgrade has been successful, do two things:

1.  go to the ``nmag-0.1`` directory, and run ``bin/nsimversion``, i.e.::

      $> cd nmag-0.1
      $nmag-0.1> bin/nsimversion

    This should produce output like this::

      Versions:
	nsim.svnversion        =5962
	nmag-release           =0.1
	nmag-distribution-mode =tarball
      Paths:
	nsimpath       : /Users/fangohr/local/nmag-0.1/nsim/interface/nsim
	nmagpath       : /Users/fangohr/local/nmag-0.1/nsim/interface/nsim/../nmag
	nmagpath (real): /Users/fangohr/local/nmag-0.1/nsim/interface/nmag


    where the version number (here 5962) can be found at the top.

    This should display the version number of the most recent
    version on http://nmag.soton.ac.uk.


2.  go to the ``nmag-0.1`` directory, and run ``make check``, i.e.::

      $> cd nmag-0.1
      $nmag-0.1> make check
   
    This will run a small number of selected (fast) regression
    tests. If these pass, chances are that the upgrade has been
    successful.

    The output should end similar to this::

      <...>
      interface/nmag/manual/example1/test_sphere1.py[4] ....
      interface/nmag/tests/test_trial.py[2] ..
      interface/nsim/test_reporttools.py[3] ...
      interface/nsim/test_sets.py[13] .............
      interface/nsim/test_when.py[5] .....
      interface/nsim/si_units/test_lib.py[1] .
      tests/regression/nmag/bigbar/nmag4/test_slow_bigbar.py[2] ss
      tests/regression/nmesh/import/gmsh1_0/test_gmsh1_0_import.py[2] ..
      ../../../../unit/nmeshmirror/test_nmeshmirror.py[1] .
      ../../../../unit/pycaml/test_refcount.py[1] .
      
      __________________________ reasons for skipped tests ___________________________
      reason: Skipped: "test not selected by keyword '-test_slow'"
      
      ============= tests finished: 32 passed, 4 skipped in 9.88 seconds =============

    The important information is that 32 tests have passed (the actual
    number may differ).

    Skipped tests are okay (these are the slow ones that are excluded
    for this quick check).

    If tests are reported as *failed*, then something may have gone wrong.

Method B: Debian package
------------------------

If you are running Debian (or a derived distribution such as Ubuntu or
Knoppix), you shoud be able to upgrade the ``nsim`` package: 

* Make sure the nmag-debian repository is in your
  ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` file (see `recommended procedure <install/debian.html#recommended-procedure>`__).

* become the super user (=root), i.e.::

  $> su -
  
* Update the database of software that is available to install by running::

  $> aptitude update


* Update the nsim package (which provides nmag) by running::

  $> aptitude install nsim

This completes the upgrade procedure. To check whether the upgrade has been successful, do two things:

1. You can check which version is installed by running the ``nsimversion`` command.

2. You can run a few regression tests by calling ``nmagcheck.sh``.


Method C: Knoppix CD
--------------------

The Knoppix distribution is Debian based, so you can follow the
instructions for `Method B: Debian package`_ to upgrade the Knoppix
system you have already. Or download an updated iso image. 

Method D: Nmag Virtual Machine
------------------------------

The Virtual machine operating system is also a Debian Linux
installation, so you can follow the instructions for `Method B: Debian
package`_. Note that the default password for root is ``nmag`` if you
have not changed this after downloading the virtual machine.

You can, of course, also download the updated virtual machine from
nmag.soton.ac.uk, but (i) you download a lot of bytes that haven't
changed and (ii) you may have modified the virtual machine, or saved
your own data etc. For these reasons, you may prefer to upgrade the
Nmag software on the virtual machine you have already.
