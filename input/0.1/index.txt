Release 0.1 beta (6156) 30 March 2009
-------------------------------------


* Bugfixes:
  
  * Fixed bug that resulted in simulation hanging when running in MPI
    mode (6039)
  
  * Solved error in regression test (test_gmsh1_0_import.py). The error
    was in the test code, not in the conversion code. (5987)
  
  
* New Features:
  
  * New functionality: Zhang-Li spin torque coupling term for uniform
    current densities added and documented. (6133)
  
* Improvements:
  
  * Reduced memory footprint (by approx 7% for the problem in manual/example2) 
    (6098)
  
  * Documented ``load_m_from_h5file`` (6041) and ``save_restart_file`` (6096)
  
  * Document LLG equation of motion (new subsection in section
    Background), and llg_gamma_G parameter in MagMaterials (6014)
  
  * Added more ``save=`` usage examples for hysteresis() and relax()
    functions (6096) in documentation of hysteresis command.
  
  * Added MPI-regression tests (6031)
  
  * tidied up file tree (removing out-dated examples, etc) (6059)
  
  * Added mpi debug function nmag.mpi_hello() (6068)
  
  * Allow to switch on debug messages from slaves (usually switched off) 
    using --slavelog

  * Adding release date to output of nsimversion (6153)
  
* Interface change:
  
  * Configuration files (RUNID_*.conf) are now only written when the
    --dumpconf switch is provided (6093)


In this release, we update the `install from source
<install/install_a.html>`__, the `debian package (etch)
<install/debian.html>`_, and the `virtual machine
<install/vmplayer.html>`_ to version 0.1-6156.
  


Release 0.1 beta (5962) 20 November 2008
----------------------------------------

* Bugfixes/Improvements

  * New feature: Can read finite element meshes produced with Gmsh using
    the new ``--gmsh`` switch for the ``nmeshimport`` tool. (5924)
  
  * Added more regression tests
  
  * Fixed bug that stopped simulations where two magnetic materials
    (each defined as a different region in the mesh) touch each other
    (5886)
  
  * Fixed bug that didn't allow to have different (potentially
    unrelated) simulation objects in the same nmag-program (5956)
  
  * Fixed bug that (sometimes) stopped the --restart mechanism 
    to continue interrupted hysteresis loop calculations (5907)
  
  * Fixed bug that prevented ``sim.get_subfield_positions`` and
    ``sim.get_subfield_sites()`` from working. (5933)
  
  


Release 0.1 beta (5878) 13 October 2008
---------------------------------------

* Bugfixes/Improvements
  
  * bugfix: reinitialisation used to reset the stage_time and stage_step
    counters. This is now fixed and is done explicitly in the hysteresis method.
    This functionality is needed to study systems where the applied field
    changes in time (5848).
  
  * bugfix: allow from source compilation on (K)Ubuntu 8.04. The bug is
    with the Petsc library 2.3.2. We have upgraded the Petsc library to
    2.3.3 in the compile from source installation, which resolves the
    problem (5851). 
  
  * bugfix: reading Gambit meshes works without warnings (5852).
  
  * bugfix: A missing ``.petsc`` file in the user's home directory
    resulted in an error message when nsim was started. This did create
    the missing file, so all is fine the next time nsim is
    called. Revision (5853) fixes this.
  
  * Improvement: Split hysteresis example in tutorial into two
    examples. The first can be used to play around with thecommand andto
    quickly complete a simulation. The second allows to compare the
    resulting hysteresis loop with an analytical prediction (5876).
  
  * minor improvements in makefile for installation from source (5859).
  
* Interface changes
  
  None.



Release 0.1 beta (5834) 2 September 2008
----------------------------------------

* Bugfixes/Improvements/New Features

  * bugfix: disabled diagnostic debug code that caused segfault for
    large meshes (approximately over 130,000 volume elements)

  * bugfix: including documentation for
    Simulation.get_subfield_average() in manual
  
  * nmeshipmort has slightly improved error reporting when attempting to
    import an unknown mesh format
  

* Interface changes
  
  None.
  

Release 0.1 beta (5787) 8 August 2008
-------------------------------------


* Bugfixes/Improvements/New Features
  
  * We have a new distribution mode using VMWare's vmplayer. This is
    particularly attractive to MS Windows users. This is at a very
    early stage and and we invite feedback from early adaptors (see
    installation Method D).
  
  * Updated the Knoppix CD to the most recent version (installation Method C). 
    Also included Netgen, a mesh generator, in the CD image.
  
  * ncol can now process OOMMF's odt files (use --odt switch)
  
  * Bugfix: the previous debian package could only execute on CPUs with sse2 extension.
  
  * Bugfix: fixed embarrassing bug that appeared with the last release
    (printing of applied field brakes when first component is zero).
  
* Interface change
  
  * removed support for thermal fluctuations. There appeared to be no
    up-take of this feature, and maintaining this (while developing the
    code further, parallelising it and making faster and leaner) was
    unnecessarily binding resources.



Release 0.1 beta (5734) 1 August 2008
-------------------------------------


* Bug fixes/Improvements/New Features

  * Reduced memory requirements by approximately 20% (due to better
    compression of sparse matrices)
  
  * Updated code working with hdf5 files to be compatible with pytables
    version 1 and 2 (no immediate effect on user if using compile from
    source, but allows to link to existing pytables2). By default we
    are still using pytables1 (but expect to switch at some point in the
    future, which should be transparent to users).
    
  * Change from numpy 1.0.1 to 1.1.0. in compile from source distribution.
  
  * More detailed progress reporting in nmagpp (useful if data files
    become large, i.e. a GB and more).
  
  * More detailed progress report in setup phase.
  
  * More detailed progress reporting in hysterises/relax commands.
  
  * Made compile from source work for Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard)

  * Introduced unit and regression tests.

* Interface changes

  (None)

.. comment:

  Where can I find ...
  --------------------
  
  - some examples showhing how to use nmag?
  - an explanation of what fields and subfields are?
  - information on finite element meshes?
  - acknowledgements?
  
  You can find all this (and a lot more) in the manual (`html
  <manual/html/manual.html>`__ or `pdf <manual/manual.pdf>`__).
