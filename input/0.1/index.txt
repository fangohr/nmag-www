Changelog
=========

Release 0.1 beta (5776) 8 August 2008 (current)
-----------------------------------------------


* Bugfixes/Improvements/New Features
  
  * We have a new distribution mode using VMWare's vmplayer. This is
    particularly attractive to MS Windows users. This is at a very early
    stage and and we invite feedback from early adaptors.
  
  * Updated the Knoppix CD to the most recent version.
  
  * ncol can now process OOMMF's odt files (use --odt switch)
  
  * Bugfix: the previous debian package could only execute on CPUs with sse2 extension.
  
  * Bugfix: fixed	embarrassing bug that appeared with the last release
    (printing of applied field brakes when first component is zero).
  
* Interface change
  
  * removed support for thermal fluctuations. There appeared to be no
    up-take of this feature, and maintaining this (while developing the
    code further, parallelising it and making faster and leaner) was
    unnecessarily binding resources.



Release 0.1 beta (5734) 1 August 2008
-------------------------------------


* Bug fixes/Improvements/New Features

  * Reduced memory requirements by approximately 20% (due to better
    compression of sparse matrices)
  
  * Updated code working with hdf5 files to be compatible with pytables
    version 1 and 2 (no immediate effect on user if using compile from
    source, but allows to link to existing pytables2). By default we
    are still using pytables1 (but expect to switch at some point in the
    future, which should be transparent to users).
    
  * Change from numpy 1.0.1 to 1.1.0. in compile from source distribution.
  
  * More detailed progress reporting in nmagpp (useful if data files
    become large, i.e. a GB and more).
  
  * More detailed progress report in setup phase.
  
  * More detailed progress reporting in hysterises/relax commands.
  
  * Made compile from source work for Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard)

  * Introduced unit and regression tests.

* Interface changes

  (None)


Release 0.1 beta (5531) 2 June 2008
-----------------------------------


* Bug fixes/Improvements/New Features
  
  * The current release, distribution mode, svn release number and
    location of the nmag-python libraries are provided (to stdout and
    logfile) when a simulation object is created. 
  
  * Re-designed and implemented calculation of the Jacobi matrix: The
    new approach 
  
    - slightly more computation time is spent during the main simulation
      whenever the Jacobian needs to be re-computed
  
    - the setup phase takes (notably) less time.
  
    - simulations with the new approach need about 30% less memory 
  
  * Matrix setup is now parallised.
  
  * Documented the use of MPI in the manual to carry out parallel runs.
  
  * Bugfix: Code now working with MPICH2.
  
  * Bugfix: The compilation from source works (again) for Mac OS X.
  
  * Switched to pvode (the parallel solver for time integration) by default.
    Updated timestepper tolerances section accordingly.
  
  * Feature enhancement: can save spatially resolved fields using the
    save_data command in any order (previsouly, it was possible to stick
    to the same set of saved fields for every saved timestep). 
  
  * Update of manual in several places (including recommendation how to
    cite nmag in FAQ).
  
  * A number of (smaller) bugfixes.

  
* Interface changes

  * The use of ``row`` for the analysis of nmag's ``_dat.h5`` data files
    has been superseeded with the use of ``id``\ s (see explanation in
    manual).
  
    This has the following side effect: the nmagpp command labels vtk
    file using the mask NAME-00XX.vtk where XX is an increasing
    number. This used to be the 'row' number for saved fields. Because
    it is now possible to save any fields in any order, the value of XX
    is now replaced with the unique id of a saved configuration. This
    also allows easier identification of a saved configuration with an
    entry in the ndt file (via the id).
  
  * nmagpp used to have a switch ``--field`` which allowed to choose
    *one* field that should be dumped (``--dump``) or converted to vtk
    files (``--vtk``). The functionality has now been extended so that
    *a list of fields* can be given, such as ``nmagpp --fields
    m,phi,H_demag --vtk myvtkfiles.vtk
    mysimulation_dat.h5``. Consequently, the switch has been renamed
    from ``--field`` to ``--fields``.

.. comment:

  Where can I find ...
  --------------------
  
  - some examples showhing how to use nmag?
  - an explanation of what fields and subfields are?
  - information on finite element meshes?
  - acknowledgements?
  
  You can find all this (and a lot more) in the manual (`html
  <manual/html/manual.html>`__ or `pdf <manual/manual.pdf>`__).
