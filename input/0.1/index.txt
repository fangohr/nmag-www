Release 0.1 beta (6481) 22 December 2009
----------------------------------------

* New Features

  * Support of Hierarchical Matrix compression for boundary element matrix. See
    `example in documentation <manual/html/manual.html#compression-of-the-boundary-element-matrix-using-hlib>`__ for details, and `Knittel et al 105, 07D542 (2009)
    <http://link.aip.org/link/?JAPIAU/105/07D542/1>`__ (`postprint pdf
    <http://www.soton.ac.uk/~fangohr/publications/postprint/Knittel_etal_JAP_105_07D542_2009.pdf>`__). This reduces the memory requirements for the boundary element matrix substantially.
  
* Bugfixes/Improvements
  
  * Minor improvements manual (Example 1 and 2, nmagpp, mayavi, 6170, updated MPI section)
  
  * Updated plot.dat and plots for Example Hysteresis loop for thin disk to fix
    documentation bug (thanks to Weiwei Wang for spotting this, 6326).
  
  * The time stopping criteria are now more faithfully respected. A new optional
    argument, 'exact_tstop', has been added to 'Simulation.advance_time' and to
    'Simulation.set_params' to give more freedom to the time integrator, in case
    performance is a concern and exact time-stopping is not really needed.
  
  * Updated packages to their latest stable release in the compile from source.
    We are now using: Sundials 2.3.0, HDF5 1.6.10, Python 2.6.4, pytables 2.1.2,
    NumPy 1.3.0, IPython 0.10. 

    This means an existing from-source installation *can not* be
    updated using ``make update``.

  * The regression tests can now be called with three different targets (6430):
  
    make check : runs all fast tests (should complete in less than 5
    minutes). This is a good test to run after compiling nmag (from source).
  
    make checkmpi   : runs mpi-related checks
  
    make checkslow  : runs tests that take longer (order of hours)
  
    make checkall   : run all tests together  
  
    (Previously, the mpi tests were part of target 'check'.)
  
  * The virtual machine is now based on Debian Lenny (the current
    stable version of Lenny).

* Interface changes
  
  * We stop providing a Debian package for this release. The from source
    compile works out of the box on Debian systems.

In this release, we update the `install from source <install/install_a.html>`__, and the `virtual machine <install/vmplayer.html>`_ to version 0.1-6481.



Release 0.1 beta (6163) 30 March 2009
-------------------------------------

* Bugfixes:
  
  * Fixed bug that resulted in simulation hanging when running in MPI
    mode (6039)
  
  * Solved error in regression test (test_gmsh1_0_import.py). The error
    was in the test code, not in the conversion code. (5987)
  
  
* New Features:
  
  * New functionality: Zhang-Li spin torque coupling term for uniform
    current densities added and documented. (6133)
  
* Improvements:
  
  * Reduced memory footprint (by approx 7% for the problem in manual/example2) 
    (6098)
  
  * Documented ``load_m_from_h5file`` (6041) and ``save_restart_file`` (6096)
  
  * Document LLG equation of motion (new subsection in section
    Background), and llg_gamma_G parameter in MagMaterials (6014)
  
  * Added more ``save=`` usage examples for hysteresis() and relax()
    functions (6096) in documentation of hysteresis command.
  
  * Added MPI-regression tests (6031)
  
  * tidied up file tree (removing out-dated examples, etc) (6059)
  
  * Added mpi debug function nmag.mpi_hello() (6068)
  
  * Allow to switch on debug messages from slaves (usually switched off) 
    using --slavelog

  * Adding release date to output of nsimversion (6153)
  
* Interface change:
  
  * Configuration files (RUNID_*.conf) are now only written when the
    --dumpconf switch is provided (6093)


In this release, we update the `install from source <install/install_a.html>`__, the `debian package (etch) <install/debian.html>`_, and the `virtual machine <install/vmplayer.html>`_ to version 0.1-6163.

  Where can I find ...
  --------------------
  
  - some examples showhing how to use nmag?
  - an explanation of what fields and subfields are?
  - information on finite element meshes?
  - acknowledgements?
  
  You can find all this (and a lot more) in the manual (`html
  <manual/html/manual.html>`__ or `pdf <manual/manual.pdf>`__).
