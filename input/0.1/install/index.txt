How can I install nmag?
=======================

This depends on your operating system.

Mac OS X
--------

You can compile nmag and required helping libraries from source (see
`Method A: compile everything from source`_).


Debian Linux, Ubuntu, Knoppix and other debian derivatives
----------------------------------------------------------

You can install the debian package (see `Method B: debian package`_).

Other Linux/UNIX
----------------

You can compile nmag and required helping libraries from source (see
`Method A: compile everything from source`_).


Windows
-------

There is currently no nmag version for Windows. You have two options of running nmag:

1. You use the bootable CD provided in `Method C: Knoppix CD`_ to boot
   your PC from the CD into a running (linux) system. This is ideal to
   test the program (and will not modify your hard drive).

2. You install a virtual machine (http://www.vmware.com, try vmware
   workstation) on your Windows machine, and run Linux inside this
   virtual machine.

   You have several options what Linux to run inside the virtual
   machine. We recommend that you 

   * either install a debian-based Linux (such as http://www.debian.org/ or
     http://www.ubuntu.com/ for example), and use `Method B: debian
     package`_ to install nmag. 

   * Or you can use the CD from `Method C: Knoppix CD`_ and simply boot
   * the virtual machine from this CD.
