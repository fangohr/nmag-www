How can I install nmag for Windows/Linux/Mac OSX?
=================================================

Mac OS X
--------

You can compile nmag and required helping libraries from source
(`download tar file <../download/nmag-0.1-all.tar.gz>`__, `Method A
installation instructions <install_a.html>`__).

If you have VMware Fusion, you can run the Nmag Virtual Machine (see
`Method D <vmplayer.html>`_).


Debian Linux, Ubuntu, Knoppix and other debian derivatives
----------------------------------------------------------

Please `compile from source <install_a.html>`__. 

There is a debian package available for the Nmag release 6131 from March 2009 (see `Debian package installation instructions <debian.html>`__).

You can also use the Nmag Virtual Machine (`Method D <vmplayer.html>`__).


Linux/UNIX in general
---------------------

You can compile nmag and required helping libraries from source
(`download tar file <../download/nmag-0.1-all.tar.gz>`__, `Method A
installation instructions <install_a.html>`__)

You can also use the Nmag Virtual Machine (`Method D <vmplayer.html>`__).


Windows
-------

There is currently no nmag version for Windows. You have two options
of running nmag:

1. You install a virtual machine player on your Windows machine, and
   run the Nmag virtual machine in this application (`Method D <vmplayer.html>`__). This is the right choice for most users who want
   to use nmag.

2. You can use the bootable CD (`download  <http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/cd-images>`__, `Method C instructions <knoppix.html>`__) to boot your PC from the CD into a running (linux)
   system. This is ideal to test nmag (and will not modify your
   hard drive).

   Note that with this setup you will run out of memory sooner than
   with any other method, as part of the RAM is used as a RAM
   disk. That is typically no problem if you just want to compute a
   few examples from the tutorial.

   This release is out-of-date.

What installation methods are provided?
=======================================

This section repeats information listed above under `How can I install
nmag for Windows/Linux/Mac OSX?`_. Here, it is not ordered according
to the operating system you are interested in, but lists the different
installation methods that are provided.


Method A: compile everything from source
----------------------------------------

Download a large archive that provides nmag together with (nearly) all
required tools, and compile everything from source. Compile time is
between 15 minutes and one hour, disk space required about 1 GB. 

:OS: 

  all Linux systems, Mac OS X

:Hardware: 
 
  i386, PowerPC, . . .

:latest: Yes (latest version provided)

:Read more: 

  `Installation instructions Method  A <install_a.html>`__.


Method B: Debian package
------------------------

A debian package is provided. This is very convenient if you happen to
run a debian (etch) distribution, or linux distributions that are
derived from Debian (such as Ubuntu).

:OS: Debian and related

:Hardware: i386 

:latest: No (version 6131 available)

:Read more: 
   `Installation instructions Method B <debian.html>`__ 
  

Method C: Knoppix CD
--------------------

An CD iso image is provided which can be burnt to an CD. Any i386
machine can use this CD to boot from. This will boot into a special
Linux distribution (*Knoppix*) which has nmag installed. This process
will not touch the harddrives in the machine, and can thus be used to
evaluate Nmag quickly without needing any disk space. 

:OS:
  All (as the installed operating system will not be used, but an operating system is provided on the CD)

:Hardware:
  i386 

:latest: No (version 5878 available)

:Read more:
  `Installation instructions Method C <knoppix.html>`__.


Method D: Virtual Appliance
---------------------------

A *Virtual appliance* (also called virtual machine) is provided that
provides a (Debian etch) Linux environment, including nmag, a mesh
generactor (Netgen) and many post-processing tools (MayaVi, Gnuplot,
Xmgrace, ...)

The Virtual appliance is basically an operating system together with
applications stored in a directory, and can be executed using the
VMWare Player. One therefore needs to download an install VMWare
Player, and can subsequently run this Virtual appliance in a window
(or in full-screen mode) along side your usual operating system.

The advantages of this approach are that

* one can carry on using your normal Operating system (say, Windows)

* No need to compile anything, or install extra software

* Data can be saved and kept on the Virtual Machine, or transferred to
  the host system (the Windows machine) using the 'shared folders'
  mechanism.

The only requirement is that there is a lot of disk space available
(about 5GB) to keep the virtual machine.


:OS: Windows (free), Linux (free), Mac OS X (requires VMWare Fusion)

:Hardware: i386

:latest: Yes (latest version provided)

Abbreviations used
==================

:OS: Operating System (i.e. MS Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, UNIX, VMS, ...)

:i386: 
  An intel i386 compatible processor. All modern PC have such a
  processor.

  The new Apple machines (including MacBook, Airbook,
  MacBook Pro) also have such Intel CPUs. However, the old Apples
  (including Powerbooks and ibooks) have the PowerPC chip, which is
  different.
