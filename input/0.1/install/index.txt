How can I install nmag?
=======================

This depends on your operating system.

Mac OS X
--------

You can compile nmag and required helping libraries from source (`download tar file <download/nmag-0.1-all.tar.gz>`__, `Method A installation instructions <install/install_a.html>`__). 


Debian Linux, Ubuntu, Knoppix and other debian derivatives
----------------------------------------------------------

You can install the debian package (see `Method B installation instructions <debian.html>`_).

Other Linux/UNIX
----------------

You can compile nmag and required helping libraries from source
(`download tar file <download/nmag-0.1-all.tar.gz>`__, `Method A
installation instructions <install/install_a.html>`__)



Windows
-------

There is currently no nmag version for Windows. You have two options of running nmag:

1. You use the bootable CD (`download <http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/cd-images>`__,
   `Method C instructions
   <knoppix.html>`__) to boot your PC from the CD into a running (linux)
   system. This is ideal to test the program (and will not modify your
   hard drive).

2. You install a virtual machine (http://www.vmware.com, try vmware
   workstation) on your Windows machine, and run Linux inside this
   virtual machine.

   You have several options what Linux to run inside the virtual
   machine. We recommend that you 

   * either install a debian-based Linux (such as http://www.debian.org/ or
     http://www.ubuntu.com/ for example), and use `Method B: debian
     package installation instructions <debian.html>`__ to install nmag. 

   * Or you can use the CD from `Method C: installation instructions
     <knoppix.html>`__ and simply boot the virtual machine from this
     CD.
