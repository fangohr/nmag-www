How can I install nmag for Windows/Linux/Mac OSX?
=================================================

Mac OS X
--------

You can compile nmag and required helping libraries from source
(`download tar file <download/nmag-0.1-all.tar.gz>`__, `Method A
installation instructions <install_a.html>`__).


Debian Linux, Ubuntu, Knoppix and other debian derivatives
----------------------------------------------------------

You can install the debian package (see `Method B installation instructions <debian.html>`_).

Other Linux/UNIX (but also Mac OS X, and Debian and friends)
------------------------------------------------------------

You can compile nmag and required helping libraries from source
(`download tar file <../download/nmag-0.1-all.tar.gz>`__, `Method A
installation instructions <install_a.html>`__)


Windows
-------

There is currently no nmag version for Windows. You have two options of running nmag:

1. You use the bootable CD (`download <http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/cd-images>`__,
   `Method C instructions
   <knoppix.html>`__) to boot your PC from the CD into a running (linux)
   system. This is ideal to test the program (and will not modify your
   hard drive).

2. You install a virtual machine (http://www.vmware.com, try vmware
   workstation) on your Windows machine, and run Linux inside this
   virtual machine.

   You have several options what Linux to run inside the virtual
   machine. We recommend that you 

   * either install a debian-based Linux (such as http://www.debian.org/ or
     http://www.ubuntu.com/ for example), and use `Method B: debian
     package installation instructions <debian.html>`__ to install nmag. 

   * Or you can use the CD from `Method C: installation instructions
     <knoppix.html>`__ and simply boot the virtual machine from this
     CD.

What installation methods are provided?
=======================================

This section repeats information listed above under `How can I install
nmag for Windows/Linux/Mac OSX?`_. Here, it is not ordered according
to the operating system you are interested in, but lists the different
installation methods that are provided.


Method A: compile everything from source
----------------------------------------

Download a large archive that provides nmag together with (nearly) all
required tools, and compile everything from source. Compile time is
between 20 minutes and one hour, disk space required about 1 GB. 

:OS: 

  all Linux systems, Mac OS X

:Hardware: 
 
  i386, PowerPC, . . .

  `Installation instructions Method  A <install_a.html>`__.


Method B: Debian package
------------------------

A debian package is provided. This is very convenient if you happen to
run a debian (etch) distribution, or linux distributions that are
derived from Debian (such as Ubuntu).

:OS: Debian and related

:Hardware: i386

   `Installation instructions Method B <debian.html>`__ 


Method C: Knoppix CD
--------------------

An CD iso image is provided which can be burnt to an CD. Any i386
machine can use this CD to boot from. This will boot into a special
Linux distribution (*Knoppix*) which has nmag installed. This process
will not touch the harddrives in the machine, and can thus be used to
evaluate Nmag quickly without needing any disk space. 

:OS:
  All (as the installed operating system will not be used, but an operating system is provided on the CD)

:Hardware:
  i386

  `Installation instructions Method C <knoppix.html>`__.


Method D: Virtual Appliance
---------------------------

A *Virtual appliance* (also called virtual machine) is provided that
provides a (Debian etch) Linux environment, including nmag, a mesh
generactor (Netgen) and many post-processing tools (MayaVi, Gnuplot,
Xmgrace, ...)

The Virtual appliance is basically an operating system together with
applications stored in a directory, and can be executed using the
VMWare Player. One therefore needs to download an install VMWare
Player, and can subsequently run this Virtual appliance in a window
(or in full-screen mode) along side your usual operating system.

The advantages of this approach are that

* one can carry on using your normal Operating system (say, Windows)

* No need to compile anything, or install extra software

* Data can be saved and kept on the Virtual Machine, or transferred to
  the host system (the Windows machine) using the 'shared folders'
  mechanism.

The only requirement is that there is a lot of disk space available
(about 5GB) to keep the virtual machine.


:OS: Windows (free), Linux (free), Mac OS X (requires VMWare Fusion)

:Hardware: i386
