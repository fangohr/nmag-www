Running (Installing) nmag from the Knoppix CD
=============================================

Knoppix (http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html) provides a
Linux system that can be booted directly from CD. The nmag team has
tailored a Knoppix CD so that the nmag system can be tested easily
(without having to install Linux). The CD should boot on most Intel PC
hardware.

This 'installation' should be as easy as booting from the CD. 


There is also the possibility of booting this CD within a virtual
machine (such as the `VMWare <http://www.vmware.com>`__). While one needs to
install the virtual machine software in the host system, this approach
allows running the Knoppix Linux alongside the host system.

An iso image for the Knoppix CD is available in `this directory <http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/cd-images>`__.
