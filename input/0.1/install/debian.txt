Installing nmag on a debian based Linux system
==============================================


.. contents::


Generic instructions
--------------------

To assist easy installation (and de-installation) on debian-based
Linux systems (such as Ubuntu, Knoppix, or plain Debian), we provide
(at present, i386 binary-only) packages that contain the nmag library
and the nsim framework. 

Recommended procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
Alternatively, one may add the following line to ``/etc/apt/sources.list``::
  
    deb http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/debian/ stable unofficial
  
to get access to the nsim package.

Further, add a second line to ``/etc/apt/sources.list``::

    deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ etch main non-free

to get access to the `libparmetis3.1` package which is required by nsim.

Then, run:: 
  
    $ aptitude update
  
to update the list of packages that your debian installation is aware of. Finally, run
  
    $ aptitude install nsim
  
to install nsim. This will automatically install all required dependencies.



For Debian experts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nsim can be obtained directly from
`http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/debian/dists/stable/unofficial/binary-i386/
<http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/debian/dists/stable/unofficial/binary-i386/>`__
and installed manually (using ``dpkg -i [packagefile.deb]``). However,
one needs to fulfill all requirements manually.

  

Notes for Ubuntu
----------------

Nsim employs the PETSc library, which provides parallelizable linear
algebra. This appears to work fine on Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn).

Unfortunately, Ubuntu's libpetsc package appears to be
broken. Trying to install and start nsim on Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon)
gives this error message::

  $ nsim
  /usr/bin/pyfem: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libpetsc.so.2.3.2:
  undefined symebl: queue

We have contacted the Ubuntu developers and asked to resolve this
issue. In the mean time, one workaround that reportedly works is to
replace the Ubuntu libpetsc package with Debian's. (Installing Debian
packages in Ubuntu seems to be somewhat frowned upon by Ubuntu
developers, but in this particular case it should be harmless.)

To do so, first download the debian libpetsc package from this URL:

http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/petsc/libpetsc2.3.2_2.3.2-1_i386.deb

Then, as root, give the command::

  $ dpkg -i libpetsc2.3.2_2.3.2-1_i386.deb

to replace your Ubuntu libpetsc package by its Debian cousin. While 
this should not upset anything on your system, you can, however,
nevertheless revert this change any time by giving the command::

  $ aptitude reinstall libpetsc2.3.2


If you cannot get this to work on your Ubuntu release, then we suggest
you `compile from source <install_a.html>`__, which works on any
standard linux system (including Ubuntu).




Installing the developer version
--------------------------------

Note: if you have a beta-tester password, you may gain access to the
most recent developer debian package by using the following line instead::

 deb http://user:password@nmag.soton.ac.uk/debian/ unstable unofficial

(Strictly speaking, this works but violates RFC1738.)



Installing Netgen
-----------------

Netgen is available for debian in the 'unstable' version. To get
access to this (from etch, which is the current 'stable' version),
follow these instructions:

1. Add::

     deb http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib non-free

   to your ``/etc/apt/sources.list``.

2. Run::

     $> aptitude update

3. Run::
   
     $> aptitude install netgen

  (this is likely to require an upgrade of the libc, and should be okay).

  At this point, you should have working netgen installation (you can test
  this by calling netgen)::

     $> netgen

4. If you want to carry on using etch stable in the future, then
   remove the line added to ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` in step 1, and
   update the package list again::

     $> aptitude update
