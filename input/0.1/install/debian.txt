Installing nmag on a debian based Linux system
==============================================

To assist easy installation (and de-installation) on debian-based
Linux systems (such as Ubuntu, Knoppix, or plain Debian), we provide
(at present, i386 binary-only) packages that contain the nmag library
and the nsim framework. These can either be obtained directly from 
`http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/debian/dists/stable/unofficial/binary-i386/ <http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/debian/dists/stable/unofficial/binary-i386/>`__ and installed manually 
(using ``dpkg -i [packagefile.deb]``).

Alternatively, one may add the following line to ``/etc/apt/sources.list``::

 deb http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/debian/ stable unofficial

Then, an ``aptitude update`` (or ``apt-get update``), followed by 
``aptitude install nsim`` (or ``apt-get install nsim``) will suffice 
to install the system (and resolve all the dependencies).

Note: if you have a beta-tester password, you may gain access to the
most recent developer debian package by using the following line instead::

 deb http://user:password@nmag.soton.ac.uk/debian/ unstable unofficial

(Strictly speaking, this works but violates RFC1738.)
