Release 0.1 beta (5962) 20 November 2008
----------------------------------------

* Bugfixes/Improvements

  * New feature: Can read finite element meshes produced with Gmsh using
    the new ``--gmsh`` switch for the ``nmeshimport`` tool. (5924)
  
  * Added more regression tests
  
  * Fixed bug that stopped simulations where two magnetic materials
    (each defined as a different region in the mesh) touch each other
    (5886)
  
  * Fixed bug that didn't allow to have different (potentially
    unrelated) simulation objects in the same nmag-program (5956)
  
  * Fixed bug that (sometimes) stopped the --restart mechanism 
    to continue interrupted hysteresis loop calculations (5907)
  
  * Fixed bug that prevented ``sim.get_subfield_positions`` and
    ``sim.get_subfield_sites()`` from working. (5933)
  
  


Release 0.1 beta (5878) 13 October 2008
---------------------------------------

* Bugfixes/Improvements
  
  * bugfix: reinitialisation used to reset the stage_time and stage_step
    counters. This is now fixed and is done explicitly in the hysteresis method.
    This functionality is needed to study systems where the applied field
    changes in time (5848).
  
  * bugfix: allow from source compilation on (K)Ubuntu 8.04. The bug is
    with the Petsc library 2.3.2. We have upgraded the Petsc library to
    2.3.3 in the compile from source installation, which resolves the
    problem (5851). 
  
  * bugfix: reading Gambit meshes works without warnings (5852).
  
  * bugfix: A missing ``.petsc`` file in the user's home directory
    resulted in an error message when nsim was started. This did create
    the missing file, so all is fine the next time nsim is
    called. Revision (5853) fixes this.
  
  * Improvement: Split hysteresis example in tutorial into two
    examples. The first can be used to play around with thecommand andto
    quickly complete a simulation. The second allows to compare the
    resulting hysteresis loop with an analytical prediction (5876).
  
  * minor improvements in makefile for installation from source (5859).
  
* Interface changes
  
  None.



Release 0.1 beta (5834) 2 September 2008
----------------------------------------

* Bugfixes/Improvements/New Features

  * bugfix: disabled diagnostic debug code that caused segfault for
    large meshes (approximately over 130,000 volume elements)

  * bugfix: including documentation for
    Simulation.get_subfield_average() in manual
  
  * nmeshipmort has slightly improved error reporting when attempting to
    import an unknown mesh format
  

* Interface changes
  
  None.
  

Release 0.1 beta (5787) 8 August 2008
-------------------------------------


* Bugfixes/Improvements/New Features
  
  * We have a new distribution mode using VMWare's vmplayer. This is
    particularly attractive to MS Windows users. This is at a very
    early stage and and we invite feedback from early adaptors (see
    installation Method D).
  
  * Updated the Knoppix CD to the most recent version (installation Method C). 
    Also included Netgen, a mesh generator, in the CD image.
  
  * ncol can now process OOMMF's odt files (use --odt switch)
  
  * Bugfix: the previous debian package could only execute on CPUs with sse2 extension.
  
  * Bugfix: fixed embarrassing bug that appeared with the last release
    (printing of applied field brakes when first component is zero).
  
* Interface change
  
  * removed support for thermal fluctuations. There appeared to be no
    up-take of this feature, and maintaining this (while developing the
    code further, parallelising it and making faster and leaner) was
    unnecessarily binding resources.



Release 0.1 beta (5734) 1 August 2008
-------------------------------------


* Bug fixes/Improvements/New Features

  * Reduced memory requirements by approximately 20% (due to better
    compression of sparse matrices)
  
  * Updated code working with hdf5 files to be compatible with pytables
    version 1 and 2 (no immediate effect on user if using compile from
    source, but allows to link to existing pytables2). By default we
    are still using pytables1 (but expect to switch at some point in the
    future, which should be transparent to users).
    
  * Change from numpy 1.0.1 to 1.1.0. in compile from source distribution.
  
  * More detailed progress reporting in nmagpp (useful if data files
    become large, i.e. a GB and more).
  
  * More detailed progress report in setup phase.
  
  * More detailed progress reporting in hysterises/relax commands.
  
  * Made compile from source work for Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard)

  * Introduced unit and regression tests.

* Interface changes

  (None)




Release 0.1 beta (5531) 2 June 2008
-----------------------------------


* Bug fixes/Improvements/New Features
  
  * The current release, distribution mode, svn release number and
    location of the nmag-python libraries are provided (to stdout and
    logfile) when a simulation object is created. 
  
  * Re-designed and implemented calculation of the Jacobi matrix: The
    new approach 
  
    - slightly more computation time is spent during the main simulation
      whenever the Jacobian needs to be re-computed
  
    - the setup phase takes (notably) less time.
  
    - simulations with the new approach need about 30% less memory 
  
  * Matrix setup is now parallised.
  
  * Documented the use of MPI in the manual to carry out parallel runs.
  
  * Bugfix: Code now working with MPICH2.
  
  * Bugfix: The compilation from source works (again) for Mac OS X.
  
  * Switched to pvode (the parallel solver for time integration) by default.
    Updated timestepper tolerances section accordingly.
  
  * Feature enhancement: can save spatially resolved fields using the
    save_data command in any order (previsouly, it was possible to stick
    to the same set of saved fields for every saved timestep). 
  
  * Update of manual in several places (including recommendation how to
    cite nmag in FAQ).
  
  * A number of (smaller) bugfixes.

  
* Interface changes

  * The use of ``row`` for the analysis of nmag's ``_dat.h5`` data files
    has been superseeded with the use of ``id``\ s (see explanation in
    manual).
  
    This has the following side effect: the nmagpp command labels vtk
    file using the mask NAME-00XX.vtk where XX is an increasing
    number. This used to be the 'row' number for saved fields. Because
    it is now possible to save any fields in any order, the value of XX
    is now replaced with the unique id of a saved configuration. This
    also allows easier identification of a saved configuration with an
    entry in the ndt file (via the id).
  
  * nmagpp used to have a switch ``--field`` which allowed to choose
    *one* field that should be dumped (``--dump``) or converted to vtk
    files (``--vtk``). The functionality has now been extended so that
    *a list of fields* can be given, such as ``nmagpp --fields
    m,phi,H_demag --vtk myvtkfiles.vtk
    mysimulation_dat.h5``. Consequently, the switch has been renamed
    from ``--field`` to ``--fields``.





Release 0.1 beta (5282) 5 February 2008
---------------------------------------

* Interface changes

  * Have changed version of petsc in tarball distribution. Used to be
    2.3.1 and is now 2.3.2. (to be consistent with debian
    packages). Users who have older tarballs, need to obtain a new
    tarball to update (updating the nsim-core is not sufficient).

* Bug fixes/Improvements

  * The change in the petsc version increases the setup phase
    significantly (for installations from source).


Release 0.1 beta (5274) 3 February 2008
---------------------------------------

* As 0.1 beta (5259) but with working debian package.

Release 0.1 beta (5259) 30 January 2008
---------------------------------------

* Bug fixes/Improvements
   
  * ticket 126: Calculation of exchange energy, demag energy, Zeeman
    energy and total energy had wrong sign; now working correctly.
    
  * increased speed of setup phase slightly.

  * decreased memory usage for runs with anisotropy.
    

* Interface changes

  * Have changed version of mpich in tarball distribution. Used to be
    mpich2.0 but is mpich1.0 from now on (to be consistent with debian
    packages). Users who have older tarballs and want to use MPI
    execution, need to obtain a new tarball to update (updating the
    nsim-core is not sufficient).

* New features

  None

Note: there is no debian package for this release.

Release 0.1 beta (4947) 20 December 2007
----------------------------------------

* Bug fixes/Improvements

  * resolved ticket 101: Setting
    anisotropy=nmag.uniaxial_anisotropy(K1=0) in MagMaterial produces
    an error message;
 
  * resolved ticket 103: When starting from a zero torque configuration the simulation
    proceeds up to the maximum time (which is 1 s) and here it stops:
    now an appropriate error message is displayed.

  * resolved ticket 97: Unrecognised architecture causes compilation failure in the
    bem3d module: now the architecture flag will be empty if the architecture
    detection fails.

  * reduced setup speed by approximately a factor 2 

  * added new section on sundials tolerances in manual (guided tour)

* Interface changes
  
  None.


* New features
