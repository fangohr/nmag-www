Release 0.1 beta (5531) 2 June 2008
-----------------------------------


* Bug fixes/Improvements/New Features
  
  * The current release, distribution mode, svn release number and
    location of the nmag-python libraries are provided (to stdout and
    logfile) when a simulation object is created. 
  
  * Re-designed and implemented calculation of the Jacobi matrix: The
    new approach 
  
    - slightly more computation time is spent during the main simulation
      whenever the Jacobian needs to be re-computed
  
    - the setup phase takes (notably) less time.
  
    - simulations with the new approach need about 30% less memory 
  
  * Matrix setup is now parallised.
  
  * Documented the use of MPI in the manual to carry out parallel runs.
  
  * Bugfix: Code now working with MPICH2.
  
  * Bugfix: The compilation from source works (again) for Mac OS X.
  
  * Switched to pvode (the parallel solver for time integration) by default.
    Updated timestepper tolerances section accordingly.
  
  * Feature enhancement: can save spatially resolved fields using the
    save_data command in any order (previsouly, it was possible to stick
    to the same set of saved fields for every saved timestep). 
  
  * Update of manual in several places (including recommendation how to
    cite nmag in FAQ).
  
  * A number of (smaller) bugfixes.

  
* Interface changes

  * The use of ``row`` for the analysis of nmag's ``_dat.h5`` data files
    has been superseeded with the use of ``id``\ s (see explanation in
    manual).
  
    This has the following side effect: the nmagpp command labels vtk
    file using the mask NAME-00XX.vtk where XX is an increasing
    number. This used to be the 'row' number for saved fields. Because
    it is now possible to save any fields in any order, the value of XX
    is now replaced with the unique id of a saved configuration. This
    also allows easier identification of a saved configuration with an
    entry in the ndt file (via the id).
  
  * nmagpp used to have a switch ``--field`` which allowed to choose
    *one* field that should be dumped (``--dump``) or converted to vtk
    files (``--vtk``). The functionality has now been extended so that
    *a list of fields* can be given, such as ``nmagpp --fields
    m,phi,H_demag --vtk myvtkfiles.vtk
    mysimulation_dat.h5``. Consequently, the switch has been renamed
    from ``--field`` to ``--fields``.





Release 0.1 beta (5282) 5 February 2008
---------------------------------------

* Interface changes

  * Have changed version of petsc in tarball distribution. Used to be
    2.3.1 and is now 2.3.2. (to be consistent with debian
    packages). Users who have older tarballs, need to obtain a new
    tarball to update (updating the nsim-core is not sufficient).

* Bug fixes/Improvements

  * The change in the petsc version increases the setup phase
    significantly (for installations from source).


Release 0.1 beta (5274) 3 February 2008
---------------------------------------

* As 0.1 beta (5259) but with working debian package.

Release 0.1 beta (5259) 30 January 2008
---------------------------------------

* Bug fixes/Improvements
   
  * ticket 126: Calculation of exchange energy, demag energy, Zeeman
    energy and total energy had wrong sign; now working correctly.
    
  * increased speed of setup phase slightly.

  * decreased memory usage for runs with anisotropy.
    

* Interface changes

  * Have changed version of mpich in tarball distribution. Used to be
    mpich2.0 but is mpich1.0 from now on (to be consistent with debian
    packages). Users who have older tarballs and want to use MPI
    execution, need to obtain a new tarball to update (updating the
    nsim-core is not sufficient).

* New features

  None

Note: there is no debian package for this release.

Release 0.1 beta (4947) 20 December 2007
----------------------------------------

* Bug fixes/Improvements

  * resolved ticket 101: Setting
    anisotropy=nmag.uniaxial_anisotropy(K1=0) in MagMaterial produces
    an error message;
 
  * resolved ticket 103: When starting from a zero torque configuration the simulation
    proceeds up to the maximum time (which is 1 s) and here it stops:
    now an appropriate error message is displayed.

  * resolved ticket 97: Unrecognised architecture causes compilation failure in the
    bem3d module: now the architecture flag will be empty if the architecture
    detection fails.

  * reduced setup speed by approximately a factor 2 

  * added new section on sundials tolerances in manual (guided tour)

* Interface changes
  
  None.


* New features
  
  * Writing sundials performance data in log file (_cvode.log)
