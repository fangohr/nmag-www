Release 0.1 beta (5282) 5 February 2008
---------------------------------------

* Interface changes

  * Have changed version of petsc in tarball distribution. Used to be
    2.3.1 and is now 2.3.2. (to be consistent with debian
    packages). Users who have older tarballs, need to obtain a new
    tarball to update (updating the nsim-core is not sufficient).

* Bug fixes/Improvements

  * The change in the petsc version increases the setup phase
    significantly (for installations from source).


Release 0.1 beta (5274) 3 February 2008
---------------------------------------

* As 0.1 beta (5259) but with working debian package.

Release 0.1 beta (5259) 30 January 2008
---------------------------------------

* Bug fixes/Improvements
   
  * ticket 126: Calculation of exchange energy, demag energy, Zeeman
    energy and total energy had wrong sign; now working correctly.
    
  * increased speed of setup phase slightly.

  * decreased memory usage for runs with anisotropy.
    

* Interface changes

  * Have changed version of mpich in tarball distribution. Used to be
    mpich2.0 but is mpich1.0 from now on (to be consistent with debian
    packages). Users who have older tarballs and want to use MPI
    execution, need to obtain a new tarball to update (updating the
    nsim-core is not sufficient).

* New features

  None

Note: there is no debian package for this release.

Release 0.1 beta (4947) 20 December 2007
----------------------------------------

* Bug fixes/Improvements

  * resolved ticket 101: Setting
    anisotropy=nmag.uniaxial_anisotropy(K1=0) in MagMaterial produces
    an error message;
 
  * resolved ticket 103: When starting from a zero torque configuration the simulation
    proceeds up to the maximum time (which is 1 s) and here it stops:
    now an appropriate error message is displayed.

  * resolved ticket 97: Unrecognised architecture causes compilation failure in the
    bem3d module: now the architecture flag will be empty if the architecture
    detection fails.

  * reduced setup speed by approximately a factor 2 

  * added new section on sundials tolerances in manual (guided tour)

* Interface changes
  
  None.


* New features
  
  * Writing sundials performance data in log file (_cvode.log)
