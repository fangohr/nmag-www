Installation of Nmag from big tar ball
======================================

* `Detailed instructions <install_a.html>`__ and 
* `Available tarballs <../download/all>`__


What is it?
-----------

The compilation of Nmag from the tar balls with names
``nmag-0.2.0-all.tar.gz`` and similar provides (nearly) all the
required libraries and tools, including Python, Petsc, Sundials, Metis
and others.

Should I use it?
----------------

Probably yes.

An advantage of this installation method is that it is (more)
independent from changing library versions: by not relying on the
Python (and Petsc, etc) provided on the system, there is no danger
that the interface of these libraries and tools is different from the
interface that the nmag code expects.

The disadvantages include that Nmag brings it's own Python and it will
thus not benefit from the Python library ``scipy`` if this is
installed for the system Python. To be able to use it within an Nmag
script, ``scipy`` would have to be installed for Nmag's Python. (This
is possible, but inconvenient.)

This way of installing Nmag is the most robust way.

  How can I install nmag for Windows/Linux/Mac OSX?
  =================================================
  
  Mac OS X
  --------
  
  You can compile nmag and required helping libraries from source
  (`download tar file <../download/nmag-0.1-all.tar.gz>`__, `Method A
  installation instructions <install_a.html>`__).
  
  If you have VMware Fusion, you can run the Nmag Virtual Machine (see
  `Method D <vmplayer.html>`_).
  
  
  Debian Linux, Ubuntu, Knoppix and other debian derivatives
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  
  Please `compile from source <install_a.html>`__. 
  
  There is a debian package available for the Nmag release 6131 from March 2009 (see `Debian package installation instructions <debian.html>`__).
  
  You can also use the Nmag Virtual Machine (`Method D <vmplayer.html>`__).
  
  
  Linux/UNIX in general
  ---------------------
  
  You can compile nmag and required helping libraries from source
  (`download tar file <../download/nmag-0.1-all.tar.gz>`__, `Method A
  installation instructions <install_a.html>`__)
  
  You can also use the Nmag Virtual Machine (`Method D <vmplayer.html>`__).
  
  
  
  
  What installation methods are provided?
  =======================================
  
  This section repeats information listed above under `How can I install
  nmag for Windows/Linux/Mac OSX?`_. Here, it is not ordered according
  to the operating system you are interested in, but lists the different
  installation methods that are provided.
  
  
  Method A: compile everything from source
  ----------------------------------------
  
  Download a large archive that provides nmag together with (nearly) all
  required tools, and compile everything from source. Compile time is
  between 15 minutes and one hour, disk space required about 1 GB. 
  
  :OS: 
  
    all Linux systems, Mac OS X
  
  :Hardware: 
   
    i386, PowerPC, . . .
  
  :latest: Yes (latest version provided)
  
  :Read more: 
  
    `Installation instructions Method  A <install_a.html>`__.
  
  
  Method D: Virtual Appliance
  ---------------------------
  
  A *Virtual appliance* (also called virtual machine) is provided that
  provides a (Debian etch) Linux environment, including nmag, a mesh
  generactor (Netgen) and many post-processing tools (MayaVi, Gnuplot,
  Xmgrace, ...)
  
  The Virtual appliance is basically an operating system together with
  applications stored in a directory, and can be executed using the
  VMWare Player. One therefore needs to download an install VMWare
  Player, and can subsequently run this Virtual appliance in a window
  (or in full-screen mode) along side your usual operating system.
  
  The advantages of this approach are that
  
  * one can carry on using your normal Operating system (say, Windows)
  
  * No need to compile anything, or install extra software
  
  * Data can be saved and kept on the Virtual Machine, or transferred to
    the host system (the Windows machine) using the 'shared folders'
    mechanism.
  
  The only requirement is that there is a lot of disk space available
  (about 5GB) to keep the virtual machine.
  
  
  :OS: Windows (free), Linux (free), Mac OS X (requires VMWare Fusion)
  
  :Hardware: i386
  
  :latest: Yes (latest version provided)
  
  :Read More: `Installation instructions Method D <vmplayer.html>`__.

  Abbreviations used
  ==================
  
  :OS: Operating System (i.e. MS Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, UNIX, VMS, ...)
  
  :i386: 
    An intel i386 compatible processor. All modern PC have such a
    processor.
  
    The new Apple machines (including MacBook, Airbook,
    MacBook Pro) also have such Intel CPUs. However, the old Apples
    (including Powerbooks and ibooks) have the PowerPC chip, which is
    different.
