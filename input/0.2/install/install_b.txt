========================================================================
GUIDE FOR INSTALLING ``nsim``/``nmag`` core FROM SOURCES (small tarball)
========================================================================

.. contents:: Table of Contents Installing Nmag from small tarball

This is installation is more complicated than the procedure involving the big tarball which is `described here <install_a.html>`__.

Installation requirements
-------------------------

Building ``nmag`` core using the small tarball requires a number of
libraries from the system, including:

* atlas3.6.0
* findlib-1.2.1
* gsl-1.14
* hdf5-1.8.7
* ipython-0.10
* mpich2-1.2.1p1
* numarray-1.5.2
* numpy-1.5.0
* ocaml-3.12.0
* ocamlgsl-0.6.0
* ParMetis-3.1.1
* petsc-lite-3.1-p5
* ply-3.3
* py-0.9.1
* Python-2.7.2
* PyVTK-0.latest
* qhull-2003.1
* sundials-2.3.0
* tables-2.1.2

The version numbers listed above are those of the libraries that are
included in the big tarball and for which nmag 0.2 core is known to
compile. You may be able to deviate from these but if the library has
changed its interface, the compilation may fail (as the changed
interface would require updates to the nmag/nsim source code). In this
case, the most practical advise would be to install from the big
tarball (that brings all the libraries with it).

You also need a `sane build environment <install_a.html>`__.

If you are running Ubuntu 11.10, have a look at the section `Ubuntu 11.10`_ below which details how to install these requirements.

Depending on hardware characteristics, compilation will take a few
minutes.

Download
--------

Download the tarball from `this directory <../download/core>`__.

Configure
---------

Untar the archive in its final location::

  $ tar xvzf nmag-core-0.2.0.tar.gz

(Once the package has been compiled, you won't be able to move the
nmag-0.2.0 directory to another location.  Doing so would make the
package unusable, since absolute paths are hard-coded inside the
executables).

Then::

  $ cd nmag-core-0.2.0

and run the ``configure.py`` script using the Python interpreter which you want to use for Nmag::

  $ python configure.py

Build
-----

Run::

  $ make

to build the software

and::

  $ make install

to create the executables. By default the "installation" takes place in the local directory, not /usr/local or such. (In theory this might be possible using configuration flags but is untested.)

Testing
-------

The testing and setting of environment variables is analog to the `installation instructions <install_a.html>`__ from the big tarball.


Special instructions
--------------------

Ubuntu 11.10
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The required libraries (with the exception of Sundials) can be installed using::

  $ sudo aptitude install libpetsc3.1-dev libpetsc3.1  \
  libfindlib-ocaml-dev libqhull-dev python-tables python-ply \
  libparmetis-dev python-dev python-py

To install Sundials (into /usr/local), you can use the following commands::

  mkdir -p build-sundials
  cd build-sundials
  wget http://dl.dropbox.com/u/357850/libs/sundials-2.3.0.tar.gz
  tar xfvz sundials-2.3.0.tar.gz 
  cd sundials-2.3.0
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-shared
  make 
  sudo make install
  cd ../..
