Changelog
=========


Release 0.2.0 December 2011
---------------------------

New Features

* Improved handling of command line arguments.
  The parsing of command line arguments now happens at the beginning, before
  the nmag module is imported. Options can be passed to PETSc using the
  --petsc-opts flag (try ``nsim -h --petsc-opts -h`` to get a list). It is then
  possible to use the logging facilities offered by the library. The
  interactive command ``nsim_i`` has been removed. Nsim detects when it is
  being used interactively and uses IPython when possible.

* Added a new command Nmagprobe for postprocessing the data. Can probe the
  magnetisation in a cubic lattice in space and time. Can convert the data
  into one or more OOMMF OVF files (both versions 1.0 and 2.0 are supported)
  and these files can be reloaded with OOMMF, for example. Can Fourier
  transform the data (in space, time or both) to obtain dispersion curves or
  the modes of the system.

* Partial PBC support for HLib. HLib can now be used together with PBC.
  Downside: the size of the HLib matrix increases with the number of copies.
  For a sufficiently large number of copies (typically 1000 or more), using
  PBC+HLib may not give any benefits with respect to PBC alone.

* Major restructuring of the installation procedure. In addition to
  the installation from a large tar ball as in the previous release,
  it is now easier to install Nmag using the system's Python and other
  libraries (assuming the versions are compatible). This has been
  tested for Ubuntu 11.10 and 11.04.

Bugfixes/Improvements

* Adjusted flags in compilation Makefile.
  PETSc compiled --with-debugging=no (~10 % speed improvement). Stopping
  when HLib compilation fails.

* Optimisation of mesh module: topology information generated only on demand,
  mesh datastructures re-engineered to occupy less memory. As a consequence
  a medium-large simulation requires less memory (reduction of 10-20 % of the
  non-BEM part) and is faster in the initialisation phase (about the same
  amount).

* Added a bug report script to collect compilation logs into a single file.
  That should considerably simplify the submission of bug reports.

* Updated packages to latest stable release in the compile from source.
  We are now using: Mpich2 1.2.1p1, Petsc 3.1-p5, Ocaml 3.12.0, Findlib 1.2.1,
  Gsl 1.14, Parmetis 3.1.1, NumPy 1.5

* Added support for Numpy array to pass data to the core simulation engine
  (makes it faster to set and retrieve fields)

* Fixed bug when reloading data from an MPI simulation with different number
  of node with respect to the one which saved the data (data is now reordered
  when loading it, if necessary)

* Reworked build system. All Nmag OCaml sources are now in one single directory
  which makes it easy to configure and build the nsim executable.

* Native compilation on Ubuntu 11.10 should now be possibe
  and relatively straightforward.

* Rewrote the test system and fixed bugs.

* Ported the documentation to Sphinx.

* Added examples to guided tour, and extended FAQ.
