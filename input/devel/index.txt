Compiling nmag libraries and nmag from source
---------------------------------------------

We assume that you are reasonable familiar with the install procedure. If not, look it up in `installation instructions (method A) <../current/install/install_a.html>`__.

Download the latest overall tar file `nmag-devel.tar.gz <download/nmag-devel.tar.gz>`__. 

Updating the nmag-core only
---------------------------

Assuming you have downloaded `nmag-devel.tar.gz <download/nmag-devel.tar.gz>`__ before, and you just want an update of the nmag core (not the other libraries such as python, petsc, qhull, ...), then:

1. download `nmag-devel-core.tar.gz <download/nmag-devel-core.tar.gz>`__

2. go to the parent directory of ``nmag-devel`` and untar::

     me@my_machine:~$ tar xfvz nmag-devel-core.tar.gz

3. Update the core::

     me@my_machine:~$cd nmag-devel
     me@my_machine:~/nmag-0.1$ . exports.bash
     me@my_machine:~/nmag-0.1$ cd nsim 
     me@my_machine:~/nmag-0.1$ rm bin/nsim 
     me@my_machine:~/nmag-0.1$ make
